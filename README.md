# Cast2Gif

A tool to convert [Asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) cast files to Gifs *without* using Electron or a web browser.

## Installing

We have yet to get CI setup for automated builds, but there is a musl Linux build that should run on any distro in our [pre-release].

[pre-release]: https://github.com/katharostech/cast2gif/releases/tag/pre-release

## Example Recording

Here is an example of a GIF created with `cast2gif`:

## Full Example

Here is a recording showing how to record a clip with [Asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) and render it with `cast2gif`:

## Features to Add

Here are some features to get in as time permits, ordered by importance:

- Support for changing the output resolution/font-size
- Add a slight bit of padding around the terminal window.
- Automated builds for Windows, Mac, and Linux so users don't have to build it themselves
- Support for custom SVG templates to allow you to style the output
- Support for rendering animated PNGs
- Support for rendering animated SVGs


## Building and Running

To build you must have at least Rust 1.42+ installed. You can install it with [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Then Run

    cargo build --release

After that the `cast2gif` program will be in the `target/release` folder.

Run `cast2gif --help` to get the usage instructions:
